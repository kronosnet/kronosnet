To: distribution package maintainers

Those are a few things about this project that you should know.

Both spec file and debian/ are up for adoption. The spec file
is most often up to date to handle current HEAD of the tree.
The debian/ directory is probably obsoleted vs current
Debian packaging guidelines.

I surely welcome patches to support both in a better way.

DO NOT ship kronosnetd. It's an experimental piece of super
crappy code. IF you decide to ship it anyway, you get to
be also the upstream maintainer :-) you have been warned.

libtap is a simple commodity library used only by kronosnetd.
I don't mind to support it, but don't ship just for the fun of it.
It has no users, that I know of, outside of kronosnetd.

libknet is still under heavy development. There might be more
onwire network changes that could make current version
incompatible with newer versions. Make sure to warn your users
about it. Plan is to release a stable version (1.0) when
we are confident that the current implementation is stable enough.

libknet has a lot of build dependencies due to its modular
implementation. It does not, however, link with all those libraries
but uses a dlopen model to save runtime resources and provide
flexibility to users to install only the libraries they are
planning to use. Make sure that you do build with all feature
enabled (compatible with your distribution licencing/patent
policy of course) and tune your packaging to Recommend/Suggest
the external libraries.

Thanks
Your upstream maintainers
