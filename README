Running knet on FreeBSD
-----------------------

knet requires big socket buffers and you need to set:
kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=18388608
in /etc/sysctl.conf or knet will fail to run.

For version 12 (or lower), knet requires also:
net.inet.sctp.blackhole=1
in /etc/sysctl.conf or knet will fail to work with SCTP.
This sysctl is obsoleted in version 13.

libnozzle requires if_tap.ko loaded in the kernel.

Please avoid using ifconfig_DEFAULT in /etc/rc.conf to use
DHCP for all interfaces or the dhclient will interfere with
libnozzle interface management, causing errors on some
operations such as "ifconfig tap down".


Rust Bindings
-------------

Rust bindings for libknet and libnozzle are part of this
source tree, but are included here mainly to keep all of the
kronosnet APIs in one place and to ensure that everything is kept
up-to-date and properly tested in our CI system.

The correct place to get the Rust crates for libknet and libnozzle
is still crates.io as it would be for other crates. These will be
updated when we issue a new release of knet.

https://crates.io/crates/knet-bindings
https://crates.io/crates/nozzle-bindings

Of course, if you want to try any new features in the APIs that
may have not yet been released then you can try these sources, but
please keep in touch with us via email or IRC if you do so.
