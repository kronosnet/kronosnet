Running knet on FreeBSD
-----------------------

knet requires big socket buffers and you need to set:
kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=18388608
in /etc/sysctl.conf or knet will fail to run.

currently, knet requires also:
net.inet.sctp.blackhole=1
in /etc/sysctl.conf or knet will fail to work with SCTP.

libnozzle requires if_tap.ko loaded in the kernel.
